		<h2>My experience at Archer Mamlmo was a lot differnt from what I expected. I expected them to be in a boring office typing their work looking like they're only there for the money and that's it. But to my surprise their office building looked fun to be at. They had a pool table, they were allowed to bring their dogs to work, and you get to leave once your work is done so you don't have specified hours. Everybody there seemed to be very laid back and relaxed and I like that kind of enviroment.

		<h2>When I got to Archer Malmo the office was very opened spaced and everyone seemed to be happy to be at work. Their presentation was very good and I enjoyed all of it. It was full of information about the company and the people who worked there. They had a mini game like game when you unsubscribed from their email subscription. They were nice and fun to watch them do their presentation they weren't boring and monotoned. Even though we sat down for two hours I still enjoyed being there and learned a lot about there company.

		<h2>When the presintation was over we started to explore the Acher Malmo building. We first went down to the photo room (I dont remember the excact term for the room but thats what im calling). The room was in the basement of the building. It had all the camera equipment and they had a curve on the wall so when they take a picture it would look infinite. Then we went to there conference rooms and they had more offices. They also kept all of their awards in a corner. They had so many awards that the box was at least 5 feet tall and they had 2 boxes full to the brim filled with awards.

		<h2>When we were done with with the trip at Archer Mamlmo we then got on the bus and started to head towards Cook Out. When we got there I could smell the food right when we got off the bus and it smelled awesome. Luckily I was able to get in the front of the line at Cook Out. I thought it would take 10 to 15 minutes for our food to come out but surprisingly even though with the long line that we created the food come out pretty quick. It was the first time I've ever been to Cook Out and it was really good. I would definetly recomend it to someone and I would rate it a 10 out of 10.

		<h2>Overall the trip was a good experience and I enjoyed it very much. I learned so much about Archer Mamlo and not just the company but the envioroment and the type of people there. I would definetly try and go visit Archer Mamlo again. I think the people there were fantastic to talk to and I hope we were good there too. Hopefully someday I can work at Archer Malmo just to have my dog at work.
